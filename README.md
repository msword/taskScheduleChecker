# taskScheduleChecker
A task to manage tasks. The service will send email and show which tasks are enabled or disabled and last ran. 


# Why I did it
There were times when we would have an outage, and the services would have to be paused, and honestly sometimes I forgot to turn them back on, and one of the times 
a service was customer facing... and well... you can guess the rest.

I set this service up to run twice a day and email me the report so I can quickly determine what is off / on.

## Just do not disable this one :)
